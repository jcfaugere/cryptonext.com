	    <td width="100%"> <p class=jcf>The quantum computer disruption is an opportunity, but also a threat to cybersecurity. Quantum computer will be able to break in few minutes the public key crypto-systems that secure Internet networks (https, IPSec VPN), mobile messaging apps (Signal, WhatsApp, …), digital signature protocols, blockchain applications, etc … A practical approach against this threat is to build quantum-resistant public key crypto-systems.</p>

	      <p class=jcf>CryptoNext Security is a spin-off of INRIA Paris, CNRS and SU, founded in 2019 by Jean-Charles Faugère and Ludovic Perret, well-known researchers with over 15 years of experience in post quantum cryptography.  As a software company CryptoNext Security’s mission is to support private and public organizations to smoothly manage the quantum threat with its quantum safe solutions.</p>

	      <p class=jcf>CryptoNext already offers « combat proven », quantum resistant, hybrid, and crypto-agile solutions for various industries (defense, finance, infrastructure, …) and technologies (HSM, VPN, PKI, IoT, blockchains, communication app, business software, …) in order to migrate IT infrastructures and products to quantum resistant level. </p>
