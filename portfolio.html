	      We developed a WhatsApp-like android application that permits to send/receive encrypted documents. The distinguishing feature of this app is to use quantum-safe cryptography to secure the communication channel.
	      The Android application has been tested during real experiments performed by French special forces. This was certainly the first large real-life deployment of quantum-safe cryptography. The application has been successfully deployed on the smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S5) of around 150 participants (military, national security, DGA,...) and experimented in various operational scenarios. The experiments were performed through a home-made 4G network deployed on a dedicated site.

	      Corda is an open-source blockchain that targets the financial sector. It is operated by R3; a company leader in the applications of blockchain in the banking and financing sectors.  Corda is a private blockchain that allows for multiple private ledgers to be created and to interact with each other. 

	      As any blockchain, the security of Corda is based -- in particular -- on public-key cryptography. Typically, this includes the use of elliptic-curve based signature scheme. The default signature used in Corda is ECDSA with the NIST P-256 curve (secp256r1). The famous Shorâ€™s algorithm will break such a signature scheme on a quantum computer. This exposes transactions operated by Corda to the quantum risk. 

	      CryptoNext developed a quantum-safe version of the Corda blockchain by integrating the CryptoNext quantum-safe software. This leads to a flexible quantum-safe version of Corda that includes the quantum-safe signature algorithms currently at the second stage of the NIST post-quantum standardization process. 

	      Corda is a first use example, but our software library can be integrated into any blockchain.   Contact us to integrate the CryptoNext software into your blockchain protocol.
