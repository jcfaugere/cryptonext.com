	      Many experts believe that there is a non-negligible probability that a large-scale quantum computer could be available in less than a decade. The Y2Q, Years to Quantum, is a countdown that refers to the number of years before when a large quantum computer will be available. The transition to quantum-resistant cryptography should be completed well before Y2Q so that any information that is later compromised by a quantum attacker is no longer sensitive.
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      This is a delicate and non-trivial task since public-key cryptography is at the core of security products.  At CryptoNext, we have the solutions to support your transition to quantum-safe cryptography.

	    <p class=jcf> The CryptoNext Quantum-Safe Library
	      CryptoNext has developed a cryptographic library that provides basic cryptographic public-key functionalities: quantum-safe signature and quantum-safe key-exchange (more precisely, Key Encapsulation Mechanism). The library is the result of the leading expertise of CryptoNext in this area: 15 years of know-how in the design, optimized implementation, and deployment of quantum-safe algorithms. This makes the library unique on the market (please contact us to know more details).  
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      The library is written in C and easy to integrate into security protocols or security products.  It is available through license. We also provide integration services of the library into security products.      
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      Our library offers a selection of the most promising quantum-safe algorithms selected at  IETF and at the second stage the NIST post-quantum standardization process. The optimal choice of quantum-safe algorithm will depend on the application considered. We can guide you to define the best-suited cipher suite.

	    <h3>Use-Case - A Quantum-Safe End-to-end Android Encryption Application.</h3>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      We developed a WhatsApp-like android application that permits to send/receive encrypted documents. The distinguishing feature of this app is to use quantum-safe cryptography to secure the communication channel.
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      The Android application has been tested during real experiments performed by French special forces. This was certainly the first large real-life deployment of quantum-safe cryptography. The application has been successfully deployed on the smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S5) of around 150 participants (military, national security, DGA,...) and experimented in various operational scenarios. The experiments were performed through a home-made 4G network deployed on a dedicated site.

	    <h2>Use-case - Quantum-Safe Version of a Block-Chain.  </h2>
	    <p class=jcf> Corda is an open-source blockchain that targets the financial sector. It is operated by R3; a company leader in the applications of blockchain in the banking and financing sectors.  Corda is a private blockchain that allows for multiple private ledgers to be created and to interact with each other.
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      As any blockchain, the security of Corda is based -- in particular -- on public-key cryptography. Typically, this includes the use of elliptic-curve based signature scheme. The default signature used in Corda is ECDSA with the NIST P-256 curve (secp256r1). The famous Shorâ€™s algorithm will break such a signature scheme on a quantum computer. This exposes transactions operated by Corda to the quantum risk. 
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      CryptoNext developed a quantum-safe version of the Corda blockchain by integrating the CryptoNext quantum-safe software. This leads to a flexible quantum-safe version of Corda that includes the quantum-safe signature algorithms currently at the second stage of the NIST post-quantum standardization process.
	    </p>
	    <p class=jcf>
	      Corda is a first use example, but our software library can be integrated into any blockchain.   Contact us to integrate the CryptoNext software into your blockchain protocol.
